 # Our Proposed Solution
 Covid 19 took the world by surprise, leaving world government endeavoring to restrict its spread. Wherein in some countries 
 the situation is well under control others are struggling to stay afloat. With many countries implementing lockdown life has
 come to screeching halt, not only is the virus targeting the health of citizens but the economy is bearing the burnt as well.
 Even major economies are struggling to cope the unprecedented demand shock and shutdown of all key economic activities that
 drive growth. Reports of job losses, unpaid leaves and other concerns are being reported on a daily basis from key sectors,
 which make up larger portion of India’s GDP. <br><br>
 
Our concern is to develop a platform to spread maximum awareness among the masses regarding the health and economic setbacks 
being faced by the world. Presenting daily updates and pandemic forecasting estimating the eradication of the virus. Also help
people in case they want some necessary items, displaying  all the services which can be used for the same, finding out safe 
time for people to go out in case of emergencies. We also aim to display the economic changes taking place and the latest 
actions being implemented by the government in that concern.
